## About
A tool I designed to allow Critical Situation Managers and Shift Leads manage cases and assigned duties related to Critical Situation Response. 

Case Assigner was utilized in part during my stay at a previous employment, however it never continued, as an official tool was developed by the parent company.

Features:
CSM's are given their own profiles, which can be modified with their work schedule, and their details, along with marking when they are away from their desks.
Shift Leads are able to view the queue of upcoming and current cases and assign them to available CSMs.
Template generator for generating note templates for use in case notes. Just fill in the details, and the template is generated automatically.
